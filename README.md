## A simple Search Tool

- This tool will help you to search within objects. 
- Here, I have taken books with their details in JSON format within an array.
- You can find the books with a specific title by typing in the input box.

This is fairly a simple project, done for the demonstration and understanding of certain react concepts such as components, props, controlled componenets etc.
